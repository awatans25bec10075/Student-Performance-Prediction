Project Problem Statement
Title: Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression and Tkinter GUI

1. Background / Context
   Educational performance prediction is an important area in academic analytics. Students’ final scores depend on factors such as study hours, attendance, and previous academic performance. Predicting these scores can help teachers identify students who may need additional support. Machine learning methods can analyze student data and provide reliable predictions. To make this accessible to non-technical users, a simple desktop graphical interface is required.

2. Problem Definition
   The problem is to develop a system that predicts a student's final examination score out of 100 using measurable inputs: hours studied per day, attendance percentage, and previous examination score.
   The system must:

* Load and process a student performance dataset.
* Train a Linear Regression model to predict final scores.
* Allow users to input values through a Tkinter GUI.
* Display the predicted score and a short interpretation message.
* Show model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

3. Objectives of the Project

* To create a machine learning model capable of predicting student performance.
* To study the relationship between key performance factors and the final exam result.
* To build a Tkinter-based GUI for easy interaction with the model.
* To integrate prediction results and interpretation messages into the interface.
* To evaluate the model using standard regression metrics.

4. Scope of the Project

* Uses three input features: hours studied, attendance, and previous score.
* Predicts final score only in the range 0 to 100.
* Linear Regression is used as the machine learning model.
* GUI application runs on systems with Python and required libraries installed.
* Does not require an internet connection.

5. Expected Output

* Predicted final exam score displayed in the GUI.
* Interpretation messages such as:
  Very good performance expected
  Good but improvement possible
  At risk
  High risk of failing
* Display of model accuracy metrics (MSE and R²).

6. Problem Constraints

* Requires a correctly formatted students.csv file.
* Accuracy depends on dataset size and quality.
* Inputs must be valid numeric values.
* Tkinter interface may have layout limitations depending on screen size.

7. Success Criteria
   The project is successful if:

* The model provides reasonably accurate predictions.
* The graphical interface functions without errors.
* Users can easily enter input values and obtain predictions.
* Evaluation metrics are displayed correctly.
