Problem Statement
The project aims to build a system that predicts a student's final exam score using basic inputs like hours studied, attendance, and previous exam marks. A Linear Regression model is trained on student data, and a simple Tkinter interface is used to make the prediction process easy for non-technical users.

Scope of the Project
• Takes three numeric inputs: hours studied, attendance, and previous score.
• Predicts final score (0–100) using Linear Regression.
• Provides a simple desktop GUI for input and results.
• Works offline on any system with Python installed.

Target Users
• Students
• Teachers and tutors
• Academic counselors

High-Level Features
• Predict final exam score
• Simple Tkinter input form
• Interpretation of results (good, average, at-risk)
• Shows basic model accuracy metrics
